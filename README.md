*Our goal is zero surprises ("WTF" moments) during code review.*
                
                
                

**Learning to read code is at least as important as learning to write it.**
**We must practice reading code and paying close attention to detail.**

Reading other people's code is the fastest way to learn, not only do you gain insight into how other people solve a problem, you also gain experience in what makes code readable (and thus maintainable).
                
                

### Questions you should go through during the code review:

* Raise issues if you spot any gaps in clarity in the code or documentation (readme, comments,etc).
* Is the file/project structure clear?
* Does the commit history tell a coherent story?
* Is the code "DRY" (i.e: limited repitition)
* Could the code be more modular?
* Are any functions poorly/confusingly named?
* Will factoring out any of your code make yout functions easier to read?

As the person reviewing code, always phrase your issues in an open-minded way (avoid "this is bad code" type issues, they are useless) use questions and seek to understand.

If you (think you) know a "better way" of solving a problem, phrase the issue as a question: e.g:              
"Would you consider using ```this``` here instead of ```that``` because of ```xyz reason```...?"
