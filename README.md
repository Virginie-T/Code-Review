*Our goal is zero surprises ("WTF" moments) during code review.*

#### Learning to read code is at least as important as learning to write it.
We must practice reading code and paying close attention to detail.

Reading other people's code is the fastest way to learn, not only do you gain insight into how other people solve a problem, you also gain experience in what makes code readable (and thus maintainable).

### Questions you should go through during the code review:

* Raise issues if you spot any gaps in clarity in the code or documentation.
* Is the file/project structure clear?
* Does the commit history tell a coherent story?
* Is the code "DRY" (i.e: limited repitition)
* Could the code be more modular?
* Are any functions poorly/confusingly named?
* Will factoring out any of your code make yout functions easier to read?

As the person reviewing code, always phrase your issues in an open-minded way (avoid "this is bad code" type issues, they are useless) use questions and seek to understand.

If you (think you) know a "better way" of solving a problem, phrase the issue as a question: e.g:
"Would you consider using this here instead of that because of xyz reason...?"
